How to get started ? 
1. Click the viva.jar file . 
2. A GUI comes up . 
3. Click the phone button on the GUI : this connects to the example in the system .Once this is done the connection to the example code is established.
4. You can see messages displayed in the console . 
5. Now click on the play button (see you tube video) 
6. You can see the architecture of the underlying system visualised .

8. Click on any of the components to get the underlying architecture. 
9. You can click on Track Messages and Backtrack messages to see current message exchanged and previous message exchanged. 

Quoting from an email from the author : According to the author , while the example code was automatically initiated in the demo video, the tool was updated to initiate the example code upon the request.
You can find out the ‘connect’ button (phone icon), which is for running the example code.If you click the button, the example code comprising one server component and two client components will be initiated (two dialogues of client components will pop up).Thereafter, if you click the ‘visualize’ button (play icon), the architecture of example code will be visualized and you will be able to use other features of ViVA.
